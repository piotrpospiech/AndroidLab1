# GUIapk

This is my project for university, which I wrote in kotlin.
I focused on good looking GUI and I didn't add any meaningful functionality.
It was done only to meet following requirements:

1. 3 Activities
2. Different layouts: linear, relative, constraint
3. Different control buttons: radiobutton, checkbox, spinner etc.
4. OnClick, OnLongClick
5. Return to previous activity
6. Toast
7. style, lock orientation, change app name etc.
8. Good looking GUI - margins, colors, font size
9. Build APK
